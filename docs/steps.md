### start ###
We will install Yeoman and Webapp generator:

```
npm install -g yo
```

```
npm install -g generator-webapp
```

```
yo webapp
```

If everything is ok you can run the application with:

```
Grunt serve
```

## step1 ##

As we want to use require, we remove al javascript tags from index.html and to avoid automatic inclusion, we remove gruntwiredep task.
